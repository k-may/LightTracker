LightTracker
=======

An application for interacting with 3D surfaces.

LightTracker provides an interface for mapping 3D models onto real structures using a depth camera. Once mapped, LightTraker uses the kinect input to track human interactions.

This piece is a continuation of earlier experimentations concerning human-architectural-interactions. Previous projects have used projection mapping.
